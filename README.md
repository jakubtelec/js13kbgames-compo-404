# js13kGames competiton entry

Tiny game made for [js13kGames](https://js13kgames.com/) competition.

Built on homebrewed, `canvas`-based, unnamed and pretty lightweight game engine :)

1. Built on [js13k-webpack-starter](https://github.com/sz-piotr/js13k-webpack-starter) with some minor modifications.
2. Spritesheets made in [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/).
3. Sounds played thanks to tiny yet mighty [ZzFx](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/ZzFX).
